# Stillness 
Stillness serves as an API and collection of Angular components used to rapidly prototype and build out graph based web applications. 

# Intruduction to Muladhara
Muladhara serves as the client facing portion of the Stillness framework, and uses Angular. Muladhara is used to create forms, input fields, lists, and to edit the Neo4j schema itself. 

# Future Planning 
Currently the Muladhara is configured to work with Angular only. I am in the middle of migrating the codebase to operate with react. This will take me a couple months. More to come soon...
